* :ref:`dataset_term`
* :ref:`lab_term`
* :ref:`template_term`

.. _project_term:

Project
=======

The project is a collection of all works when you developing a DNN models. 
You can launch a jupyterlab (we call them labs) within a project to perform experiments.


.. _dataset_term:

Dataset
=======

Dataset is any collection of data. You can organized you data into different directories (we call dataset) and modify datasets by web portal.
You can preview images and upload/download dataset files on dataset pages.
All datasets can be used in your labs.

.. _lab_term:

Lab
====

A lab is a web IDE (based on JupyterLab) organized in container basis.
You can develop DNN models in a lab and start training.


.. _template_term:

Template
========

A template is an example of a lab with specific type of DNN model with already preloaded dataset connected to it. 
Serves as an example or template for users.
